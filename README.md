📜 Overview
SBN Pakistan is a Full Stack MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) platform built entirely in the LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
It is designed to empower entrepreneurs to build their teams, refer members, and earn money through a binary tree structure that never ends — truly infinity levels.

The system is completely automated — from registration to commission payouts — allowing both admins and users to enjoy a seamless earning experience.
Its refer system ensures members are rewarded for expanding the network, creating a self-sustaining income ecosystem.

💡 Imagine a platform where your network can grow forever, with earnings cascading through infinite binary levels — that’s SBN Pakistan.

🎯 How It Works
Step 1: Registration
A new user registers through direct signup or referral link.

The system automatically assigns them a position in the binary tree.

Step 2: Network Growth
Each member can recruit two people directly.

Extra recruits spill over to the next available spot in the downline.

Step 3: Earnings
Every pair of recruits in both legs generates a Binary Pair Bonus.

Direct referrals give instant commission.

Step 4: Infinite Depth
The tree keeps growing downwards, meaning earnings from your team never stop.
